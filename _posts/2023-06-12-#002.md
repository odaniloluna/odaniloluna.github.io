*one thing I noticed in my recent research on the topic of the unconscious is that dreams have been relegated to an irrelevant place in history nowadays, meaning that a large part of the materials are restricted to the academic world. the increase in possibilities and knowledge tools hasn't resulted in a similar pursuit of information. It doesn't take much to realize, and it has become even clich√© to say, that this is a structural problem, and the name of this familiar culprit is capitalism. I won't dwell on these political considerations since this writing is just a note, a sweet attempt to synthesize some ideas. however, this practical and superficial world hardly promotes anything that requires a depth of understanding. It is clear to me that this massification drains a significant part of human potential.

*I propose a test: ask the people close to you, "what is your dream?" typically, in most cases, they will respond with things that money can buy. this is a simple and tangible way to perceive the colonization of the unconscious promoted by capitalism in the present. even in social studies, we perceive a hierarchy in the topics considered more relevant. notice that historically, a large part of sociological studies focused on aspects of culture and society (tools, rites of passage, objects for rituals, decorative items, etc.). this is not a problem per se, and it is commendable that there is an interest in this. but there are other layers worthy of observation. Rebeca Lemov, in an article based on her book 'DATABASE OF THE DREAMS: THE LOST QUEST TO CATALOG HUMANITY' recovers the research of a group of scientists who also directed their efforts towards intangible and fleeting elements such as dreams, hopes, fears, evanescent desires, states of madness, and rudimentary desires. this experimental research conducted in the mid-1950s was titled "Primary Records in Culture and Personality." At that time, the data was collected and stored using a device called a "MICROFORM" a technology that was soon abandoned with the advent of computers.

*two things to reflect on:
<br>
<br>
*Is it possible to somehow evoke the ephemeral data from the realm of subjectivity through images?
<br>
<br>
*I need to revisit my studies with abandoned/replaced technologies.
