I started organizing some ideas for a new research / basically, the process is built initially through the collection of spontaneous narratives of dreams published on the internet.
*issues I am reflecting on :

*keeping the idea of searching for dream narratives only in portuguese and from the brazilian territory? as the research progresses, I feel that brazilians are very focused on asking for the meaning, although there are narratives, many of them are hosted on obscure websites that do not easily appear in search engines.

*perhaps a good way to solve this would be to create a partnership with a programmer and develop an algorithm capable of detecting some keywords. I found two dream databases, both foreign, but the problem is that these data were not collected spontaneously but rather conducted through a previous study.
