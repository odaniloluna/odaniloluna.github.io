*I have been reflecting a lot on video art. Despite it being a medium I enjoy exploring, few of my recent projects are created using video. There is an element in this creative technique that bothers me a bit, and it's related to the modes of presentation in the visual arts context (galleries and museums). I believe that often, video art remains on the fringes during exhibitions. I confess that, even though I am an enthusiast of this type of art, I don't always manage to stop and fully appreciate a piece of work. In my case, this is heavily influenced by the space. Sometimes, there's a subtle pressure to follow a flow and timing for appreciation, though I'm not entirely sure. Consequently, I have been contemplating the logic of looping for audiovisual works with shorter durations. This influence stems from my parallel project where I create artworks in GIF format. The concept of looping appeals to me greatly as a means to condense a narrative within a short span of time.

*For me, the significant reference for a type of creation that follows the logic of looping is the artwork titled: [ TANGO / ZBIGNIEW RYBCZYNSKI (1981) ].
